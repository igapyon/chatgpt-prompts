# FullDumpPrompt v20250705a

# TASK
Using only the conversation history **before this message** (exclude this task prompt),
create three share-and-review artifacts:

1. **JSONL file** – one JSON line per utterance, fields: role + content only.

# IMPORTANT:
**Do not include this request message in the output.**
Your output should reflect only the conversation leading up to this prompt.

# OUTPUT FORMAT
Return the three artifacts in this order, each inside its own fenced code block
and preceded by the suggested filename as a heading:

## prompt\_log.jsonl

```json
{"role":"user","content":"..."}
{"role":"assistant","content":"[Content Omitted for Brevity]"}
```

# STYLE & RULES

* Language: Japanese.
* JSONL must be strict (no comments, no trailing commas).
